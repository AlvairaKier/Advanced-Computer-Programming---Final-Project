# I. Brief Project Overview

KeepSafe: A money tracking system where it keeps a data where your money go. This system allows the user to know what they do with their money, where their money go, spending their money properly appropriate with their recorded transactions separating their wallets for allowance and savings. The program includes using Python, Tkinter, and MySQL.

# II. Python Concepts, Libraries, and Database Application
## 1. Python Concepts
  - **Functions**:
    - The program used functions, breaking down the code to smaller code blocks as the program used tkinter therefore having a lot of dashboards created with different uses. Using functions keeps the program organized and maintainable.
      
  - **Collections**:
    - Tuples() and Lists[] where used during the construction of the logic for this program to efficiently use the values and attributes inside the database.
      
  - **Control Structures**:
    - Control Structures where used in this program (if-else, for loops) to have a better logical organization in the program making it more flexible and agile in responding to user inputs.
      
  - **Error Handling**:
    - Error handlings where also utilized inside this program, using the try-except code blocks to read invalid user inputs or database mismatch. Error handlings provides helpful feedbacks for the users to have an idea how to use the system/program correctly.
      
## 2. Libraries
  - **Tkinter Library**:
    - Tkinter library where used for the creation of the GUI(Graphical User Interface) that allows users to interact with the system itself, utilizing buttons, icons, windows, Treeviews, menus for the user to be more interactive when using the program.
      
  - **MySQL**:
    - The MySQL was used to have a data repository for the system containing the users, transactions, updates made by the users using the program. It also serves as a authenticator for the user log ins, users transactions, admin - account deletion and nothing but last, user-registration system ensuring a more accessible interface for the users.

# III. SDG and Its Integration into the Project

  **SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production**
   -  It focuses on promoting sustainable practices to ensure that consumption and production patterns are environmentally friendly, socially inclusive, and economically viable.
   -  The program helps the users to be a more responsible consumer by being aware of their expenses and having a provided "savings account" for them.

# IV. Instructions for Running the Program

  1. Download the `KeepSafe.zip`

2. Extract the `KeepSafe.zip` this file contains:
    - `KeepSafe` (folder):
       - `Backup`
       - `KeepSafe Program`
       - `Images Used` folder:
           - `KeepSafeLog.png`
          
  
3. Open XAMPP and start the MySQL service.

4. Import the SQL database:
    - Open the `KeepSafe.sql or KeepSafe.db` file and copy the entire script (including one blank space at the bottom).
    - Open Command Prompt and paste the script to create the necessary tables and structure.

5. Run the program:
    - Open the `KeepSafe Program` folder in Visual Studio Code and run the program.
